Assignments
-----------

Assignment instructions will be found on Canvas and in the
github.com/suwebdev account. Most weeks you will be working on a project
that is defined in a github repository. During the last three weeks of
the course you will work on your own project and there will be a week
for design, a week for build, and a week to share your work.

**Discussion Board**

You are required to post a response to the weekly Discussion prompt and
then respond to and/or incorporate feedback for other student responses.
Discussions take place in the Canvas application online.

**Synchronous Check In**

Every two weeks you must complete a synchronous check in. This can be
done by attending lab, a phone call, a face to face Zoom meeting online,
or a synchronous chat on Slack.

**Project Assignment**

Each week there will be a project assignment due. You will submit two
URL's to demonstrate your project completion. One URL will point to a
code repo on github.com and the second URL will point to the hosted code
on github.io. The first assignment will provide instruction on how to
set up these URL's.

Policies
--------

The following policies govern this course and comply with Seattle
University policies.

### Support for Students With Disabilities

If you have, or think you may have, a disability (including an
"invisible disability" such as a learning disability, a chronic health
problem, or a mental health condition) that interferes with your
performance as a student in this class, you are encouraged to arrange
support services and/or accommodations through Disabilities Services
staff located in Loyola 100, (206) 296- 5740. Disability-based
adjustments to course expectations can be arranged only through this
process.

### Academic Policies from the SU Registrar

Be sure that you understand the following university academic policies,
posted on the Registrar's website:

- [ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY](https://www.seattleu.edu/academic-integrity/)

- [ACADEMIC GRADING GRIEVANCE POLICY](https://www.seattleu.edu/media/redhawk-service-center/registrar/registrar-policies/Academic-Grading-Grievance-2004-07.pdf)

- [PERFORMANCE CRITERIA](https://www.seattleu.edu/search/?q=academics%20performance)

### Incomplete Grades

If you are unable to complete course requirements because of extenuating
circumstances, please notify the instructor on or before the date the
assignment is due and provide relevant supporting documentation (e.g.
doctor's note, note from counselor).

An agreement to receive an Incomplete (I) grade may be negotiated if
your circumstances do not allow you to finish the course on time. The
Incomplete Removal Policy of the university is available on the Office
of the Registrar web site: [Incomplete Grade
Policy](https://www.seattleu.edu/media/redhawk-service-center/registrar/registrar-policies/Incomplete-Grades-97-03.pdf).

### Assignment Deadlines and Extensions

Assignment deadlines are visible on both the Course
Syllabus and the Assignments
list (as well as the individual Assignment pages themselves). You can always
find links to those two pages in the left sidebar of the course.

Due to the nature of the work, and the online structure of the course
materials, assignment deadlines will be automatically enforced.
Generally, there will be no extensions to the assignment deadlines,
primarily because falling behind on work in this course makes it
exponentially more difficult to complete the course successfully.

If you have an obligation or responsibility that makes any deadline on
the schedule an issue, please bring up this fact to your instructor as
soon as possible. Your instructor will work with you to accommodate your
other responsibilities, but any accommodation should be planned ahead of
time in collaboration with your instructor.

### Student Responsibilities for Learning

You are expected to budget **a minimum of 10 hours per week** for this
course. For the most part, 10 hours will be adequate time to complete
all of the requirements for each week. However, given the nature of the
material in these courses, it is likely that some weeks will be more
time-consuming than others due to complexity of concepts. Please
communicate openly with your instructor about how the course is going
and let your instructor know if you are regularly spending a lot more
time to complete work. Additional tutoring or other assistance may be
available depending on the nature of the issue. You are also encouraged
to review the calendar at the beginning of the quarter to flag any weeks
that seem to you to be especially full or challenging.

Required Tools/Software
-----------------------

In order to complete the work in this course, you will need to have a
few services at your disposal:

### GitHub

You will use your GitHub account to access project resources, to host
your working repositories, and to publish your working web pages. Github
is a service that allows you to store and share your work with other
developers. It is a commonly used tool in web development, and an
essential part of these courses.

### Slack

In order to provide more immediate help and assistance, you are invited
to join the SU Web Development Slack server, which provides you with
persistent team chat with other SU Webdev students. You can use this
tool to reach out directly to your instructor, communicate with fellow
students, facilitate private chats, share files/links/code snippets, and
much more. It\'s a very handy communication tool.

You can sign up to Slack with your \@seattleu.edu email address, but
please be aware that SU email sometimes eats emails from the Slack
servers. We have not been able to resolve this issue so far. If you sign
up with your \@seattleu.edu email and you do not receive the email
validation to complete your signup on Slack, then please send your
instructor your personal email address and request access. We will send
you an invite to your personal email address and you will be able to
access our Slack server.

### Lynda.com

Anyone taking courses in King County (which includes anyone enrolled at
SU) can access Lynda.com courses [through the King County Library
website](https://kcls.org/).
Lynda.com provides video courses covering many of the topics we will
cover in this quarter. You are encouraged to use Lynda.com resources to
fill in your knowledge or provide extra practice where needed. Engaging
with Lynda.com courses is entirely optional, but they can be a more
reliable resource for information than just looking up tutorials on
Google or Youtube.

To access Lynda.com courses, you must do so through the King County
Library System or Seattle Public library system. You will need a King County
Library Card or a Seattle Public Library Car, which you can apply to get on the King County Library
System website. Once you
have your library card, you can access Lynda.com
courses.

SU Web Dev YouTube Channel
--------------------------

The SU Web Development Certificate program maintains a [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCll_nlSRML4SRkKeUW50imA) that
hosts videos useful for our students. You will find assignment
summaries, technique demos, and all sorts of information useful to many
assignments. Most assignments link directly to specific videos that are
useful for that assignment, but it\'s recommended that you subscribe to
the YouTube channel for two reasons: 1) You will get updates about new
videos as soon as they are available. 2) You can more easily access the
videos through the YouTube apps on many different devices (your TV,
Roku, Xbox, PS4, etc.).


### WATS Lab FAQ

WATS Lab Assignments require setup, configuration and processing. This
[FAQ](https://suwebdev.github.io/wats-lab-faq/) is a place to search for and locate instructions in a \"How To\"
format. Look here for instructions on operations such as creating a
gh-pages branch, setting up a local environment and more.
